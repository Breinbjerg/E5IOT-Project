This is an IoT project making a lowpower tracker prototype, for mapping the route traveled.  
When you take the device on a run, at the end of the trip you will receive an email describing the route on a map.  

## Built with:
This project is build with:
- Argon (Particle) - electrical base  
- Adafruit Ultimate GPS - to track user lokation  
- Google maps API - to generate route on map
- Mailgun API - for sending map to user 
- LiPo battery - for powering the device
